    <p>Drug shortages are ever-present in pharmacy practice. In the United States, the <a
            href="https://www.ashp.org/drug-shortages/current-shortages">American
        Society of Health System Pharmacists</a> (ASHP) publishes bulletins on drug shortages as information becomes
        known. Our free service tracks the shortage list on ASHP's website and sends you an email alert whenever a
        change is
        detected.</p>
    <h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
    <p>To start receiving email alerts, please submit your address below. We will send you a message
        with a confirmation link. <strong>You must click the link to activate your registration.</strong></p>
    <form method="post">
        <label for="email">Email</label><br>
        <input type="email" name="email" id="email" placeholder="your_name@example.org">
        <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="{{ recaptcha_key }}"></div>
        <input type="submit" value="Sign-up">
    </form>
    <h2>What changes are tracked?</h2>
    <p>Currently, we track when new drugs are added to the shortage list and when resolved shortages are removed. We do
        not yet track updates to the information on the shortage detail pages (i.e., the page that loads after you click
        on a drug name).</p>
    <h2>How often are alerts sent?</h2>
    <p>Alerts are sent whenever drugs are added or removed from the shortage list. This is typically a few times per
        month. We will never send more than one email per day.</p>
    <h2>Why am I not receiving confirmation emails or alerts?</h2>
    <p><strong>Make sure to check your spam folder</strong>. We recommend adding
        medcopia@cosmanaut.com to your address book to prevent our messages being marked as spam. If
        you are still having trouble receiving the opt-in confirmation email, re-submit your email address.</p>
    <h2>How do I unsubscribe?</h2>
    <p>Click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any message we send you.</p>
    <h2>Is my data safe with you?</h2>
    <p>Yes&mdash;the only data collected is your email address, which is not shared with anyone else.</p>
    <h2>Who provides this service?</h2>
    <p>This is a free service provided by <a href="https://eddiecosma.com">Eddie Cosma</a>, a pharmacist in Cleveland,
        OH.</p>
